        <p>This site was created by former Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment and inspired by the Rangers serving in the United States Special Operations Command. Founded in 2017, CronusFit initially provided Ranger School and Special Forces selection programming; but, shortly after seeing the gaps in fitness in many conventional units, the site developed programs tailored specifically for individuals trying to assess to other JSOC units, schools, and group training.  With the introduction of programs for cost, we realized our best use of this site was to partner with other non-profit programs to give back to individuals affected by injury or stress after service or during service to the United States Special Operations Command.  Because of this, CronusFit became a registered non-profit with the IRS and state of Colorado, returning to the founding principle of giving back. Our goal is to develop long-term programs and events throughout the United States to maximize giving back to Rangers and operators.</p>
